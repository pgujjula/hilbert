A style guide for this project
==============================

**** All source files should begin with a module header. Here is an example from
  Hilbert.ContinuedFrac

{-|
Module      : Hilbert.Digit
Description : Handle continued fractions.
Copyright   : (c) Preetham Gujjula, 2016
License     : GPL-3
Maintainer  : preetham.gujjula@gmail.com
Stability   : experimental

Handle continued fractions. This module uses mathematics described in

    * Beceanu, Marius. "Period of the Continued Fraction of âˆšn." Thesis.
      Princeton University, 2003. Web.
      <http://web.math.princeton.edu/mathlab/jr02fall/Periodicity/mariusjp.pdf>.
      Junior Thesis
    * Myerson, Gerry. "How to Detect When Continued Fractions Period
      Terminates." Mathematics Stack Exchange. Stack Exchange, 11 Dec. 2011.
      Web. 24 Apr. 2016. <http://math.stackexchange.com/a/90432>.
-}

All the fields should be in exactly this order. All the formatting should look
exactly like this. If there is nothing to add in the longer description, then the longer description should be the same as the Description field.

**** After the module header comes a newline
**** Then comes any LANGUAGE pragmas. For example, in Hilbert.PriorityQueue.Map:
{-|
Module      : Hilbert.PriorityQueue.Map
Description : A priority queue implemention as a wrapper over 'Data.Map.Map'

A priority queue implemention as a wrapper over 'Data.Map.Map'
-}

**** There should be another newline after any LANGUAGE pragmas.
**** Then comes the module name. The exported functions should be listed as so:
module Hilbert.Digit
  ( numDigits
  , sumDigits
  , toDigits
  , fromDigits) where
**** Then comes another newline
**** Then comes the imports. Imports should not have any newlines between them.
     Put standard library imports before Hilbert imports. Example:
import Data.Maybe (fromJust)
import Data.List (find, findIndices)
import Data.Ratio
import Hilbert.Square (isSquare, integralSqrt)
**** After any imports comes another newline.

********************
COMMENTS
********************
 * All functions except the most basic should have a comment describing what
   they do.
 * One line function header comments should look like:
   -- This is a comment
 * Multiline function header comments should look like:
   {- This is a multline comment.
      Line 2.
   -}
 * One line Haddock comments should look like
   -- | This is a comment
 * Multiline Haddock comments should look like
   {- | This is a Haddock comment.
      Line 2.
      Line 3.
   -}
