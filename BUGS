This is a list of known bugs that need to be addressed in the future.

* Some functions return incorrect results when called on fixed precision 
  integer types, such as Int/Int32/Int64, because some internal operations
  result in unchecked overflow.

  Current fix: Use Integer or (Integral a) => a for now.
