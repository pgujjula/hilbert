Hilbert is an exploratory library for mathematics in Haskell. I use it as a 
testbed for mathematical algorithms and structures that might be useful in other
libraries, and as a tool to help me solve Project Euler problems.

The project is experimental. If you are interested in using Hilbert, reach out
to me at libraries@mail.preetham.io.

To build, use Stack
```
git clone https://github.com/pgujjula/hilbert
cd hilbert
stack build
stack test
stack haddock hilbert --open
```
