Hilbert is an exploratory library for mathematics in Haskell. I use it as a 
testbed for mathematical algorithms and structures that might be useful in other
libraries, and as a tool to help me solve Project Euler problems.

It is expiremental, if you are interested in using Hilbert, reach out to me

To build, use Stack
